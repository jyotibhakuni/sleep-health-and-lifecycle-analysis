# sleep-health-and-lifecycle-analysis
The objective of this Stress level dataset is to analyse the various factors on which the stress level of a person depends like Age, Occupation, Quality of Sleep etc.
In this EDA project I have export the data, transformed the data , cleaned the data, visualized the data and gain meaningful insights.
I have made a dashboard using Power Bi and for EDA I have used Python.
